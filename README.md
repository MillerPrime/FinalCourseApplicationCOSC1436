# Final Course Application - COSC 1436

## What it does
This program calculates weekly pay for different types of employees.  
It supports three pay codes:
- **Manager**: Pay is based on yearly salary divided by weeks in a year.
- **Hourly worker**: Pay is based on hours worked and hourly wage, with overtime for hours over 40.
- **Commission worker**: Pay is based on a base salary plus commission from weekly sales.

For each employee, the program calculates:
- Gross pay
- Taxes paid
- Net pay  
It also prints a summary table of all employees and the total company pay for the week.
